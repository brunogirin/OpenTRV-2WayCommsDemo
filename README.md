# OpenTRV-2WayCommsDemo

Demo repo for 2 way radio communication with OpenTRV devices.

- OT2WayGateway is the hub/radio-serial gateway.
- OT2WayTRV a TRV that allows the set-point to be controlled remotely. Note that as its radio listens continuously, it is not expected to last more than a week or two on AA batteries.
